# FastChangeDirectory
Yooo, i was too silly to use the cd command to change my current directory, especially when the goaldirectory is far away, so i wrote a little script to make it faster
Its configured in linux, but i encourage you to configure it to other operating systems

Its written in python and you must install the getkey library
